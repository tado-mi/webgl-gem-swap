# Gem Swap implementation in webGL

Code written by [Megan Zhao](https://github.com/meganzhao), forked and modified by [Lusine Keshishyan](https://github.com/tado-mi) in order to practice coding in web GL. Please see the commit history for details.

Following is an implementation of the well known game [Bejeweled](https://zone.msn.com/en/bejeweled/) problem, written while taking **Computer Graphics**  course at the [Aquincumi Institute of Technology](https://www.ait-budapest.com/). It is made public to demonstrate a code sample by the authors, and for learning. We trust it will not be used to violate academic honesty policies.

## Running
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/tado-mi/webgl-gem-swap.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd webgl-gem-swap

# Open the URL of the game
